introduction: 'In the north of Greece, displaced people may live on the streets of
  Thessaloniki, in one of the camps located in smaller surrounding towns, may [seek
  permanent residence, or prepare to travel further west](https://www.refugeesintowns.org/thessaloniki).
  Recently, people have been transferred off the Greek islands while their asylum
  cases are still being processed. '
governmentResponse: In both cities and surrounding areas, there are some formal camps,
  as well as people living in squats, apartments, or without any shelter. The camps
  on the mainland are following the trends seen on the Aegean Islands, with [high
  concrete walls being built around them](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32834/greece-migrant-camps-surrounded-by-concrete-walls),
  echoing the detention centre style of accommodation. The living conditions in the
  detention centres are often deplorable.  As the registration procedure gets stricter
  many are told that they are not “vulnerable enough” for shelter, food, or monetary
  aid.
